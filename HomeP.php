         <h2>What to Expect While Driving in Egypt</h2>

           <p>
               Many driving conditions and rules in Egypt are vastly different from those in the United States, Europe and Asia.<br/> Observing these key rules will ensure a safe and enjoyable driving experience with your xDrive car rental.<br/> Although most major intersections in Egypt have stoplights, many are directed by local policeman using a series of hand gestures and finger movements.


           </p>
           <ul>
           <li>Motorists in Egypt use vehicle horns to communicate a variety of things, such as the desire to turn or pass other drivers.</li>
           <li>You are required to wear your seatbelt at all times and this law is strictly enforced.</li>
           </ul>

        <p>  Please inform yourself of all the road rules and regulations in Egypt before driving with your xDrive car rental.<br/></p>

       <h2>Experience Egypt with xDrive</h2>
           <p>
           Although Egypt is most popularly associated with the Sphinx and Great Pyramids, the country has much more to offer in the way of shopping, nature and history.<br/> When you rent a car, you have the freedom to visit as many of these memorable locations freely and at your own pace.<br/> When staying in Hurghada, you are a short drive away from Makadi Water World and the Grand Aquarium while our xDrive branches in Cairo are close to the Egyptian Antiquities Museum and the Cairo Opera House.<br/> Round out your stay in Sharm el Sheikh with a trip to the Ras Mohamed National Park or the majestic Musical Fountain of Sharm El Sheikh.<br/> When you rent a car in Egypt with xDrive you can take to the road in any direction, to an array of destinations.<br/> Enjoy the drive!
